<p>It's difficult to resist the appeal of a Beagle's dark brown or hazel eyes,
 with his soft, pleading expression. They're happy, outgoing and loving-characteristics more than balanced out by their hound nature,
 which is inquisitive, determined, and focused on food.The most important thing to know about the Beagle is that he is a scenthound.
 His nose is the most important part of his anatomy and his head is always down to the ground, searching for an interesting trail to follow.
